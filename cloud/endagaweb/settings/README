The files in this directory are used as the Django settings module when
deploying the web front-end servers, by setting the environment variable
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE (using Python module dot syntax, not path syntax,
e.g., endagaweb.settings.dev):

dev.py - local Vagrant deployment

prod.py - cloud deployment (both production and staging)

staff.py - cloud admin front-end

Each file imports some top-level settings from the cloud/settings.py module,
may set additional settings directly, and also imports a context-dependent
set of modules that provide specific additions to the base settings:

admin.py - enable the admin UI (dev and staff environments)

secure.py - enable settings recommended for increased security (prod and
staff environments)

Note that Django requires that all variables used as settings be defined
in the exact module specified in DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, hence the use of
the 'from foo import *' syntax to 'flatten' all definitions into one module.
