# In AWS, 'user data' is the aptly named optional script that can be run when
# an instance is booted. Things that should go in here are instance-wide
# configuration, like setting up CodeDeploy, logging agents, NewRelic, etc.
# Nothing application-dependent should go in here.  At some point, we can just
# bake an AMI that contains this stuff to make the script smaller.

# Set up Code Deploy so we can do installs

# Get environment now that AWS CLI is set up
# CodeDeploy may not have applied tags when we get here, so we just figure out what autoscaling group we're part of and get the tags that will eventually be applied.
